# Healthcare Query Classifier
In this problem set, a sparse matrix has already been created. We need to perform multiclass classification on this dataset. 
To do the same, we intend to use the XGBoost multi-class classifier with mlogloss as metric.
In this repo, following files are available: 
1. Query Data available as sparse matrix with last column with name as the target variable.
2. R script for doing multi-class classification.
